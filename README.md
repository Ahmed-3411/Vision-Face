## Features  
- Detects faces in static images or real-time video streams  
- Uses **OpenCV Haar Cascades** for fast and accurate detection  
- Lightweight, easy to run, and beginner-friendly  
- Can be integrated into larger computer vision projects  

---

## Technologies Used  
- **Python 3**  
- **OpenCV**  
- **NumPy**
